### Project description    
Predict a computer-generated number in the minimum number of attempts.

### What is the challenge?    
You need to write a program that guesses the number in the minimum number of attempts

**Conditions:**  
- The computer guesses an integer from 0 to 100, and we need to guess it. By "guess", we mean "write a program that guesses the number."
- The algorithm takes into account information about whether the random number is greater or less than what we need.

**Quality metric**     
Results are measured by the average number of attempts at 1000 repetitions.

**What we practice**     
Learning to write good python code


### Data info
Single integer random generated value by computer.

### Project phases
Just one phase: implement an algorithm in `random_predict` function.

### Results:  
Predicting the number in 5 attempts on average.

### Conclusions:  
Good results I believe :)
